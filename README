This tiny package demonstrates how to listen to Dbus signals in a
convenient way from Emacs.  The utility functions are geared towards
my specific use cases, but I think the simple framework can easily
used as a template to achieve whatever actions you want to have happen
when reacting to Dbus events in Emacs.
